Hashing is a technique in computer used to reduce data of arbitrary size to a fixed size output.
The output is known as hash value or digest.Hashing is commonly used in cryptography,
data indexing and data structures like hash tables.

The hash function is used to generate the hash value. which should be unique for each data input.A good
hash function has the following properties.
- Deterministic - The hash function should return the same value for the same input data.
- Uniform - The hash function should be able to distribute the available data uniform
across the possible  range of hash values
- Efficient - the hash function should be computationally efficient.

Hashing has several advantages.
including fast search and retrieval of data, efficient data storage,and fast data comparisons.
It also has limitations like possible hash collisions, but there are some methods that are available to address
hash collisions such as chaining and open addressing.

Hashing has applications in passwords storage,digital signatures and data indexing and
 data structures such as hashtables, bloom filters and merkle trees.
