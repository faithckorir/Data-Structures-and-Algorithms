    /**
     * In Java, a Set is a data structure that stores a collection of unique elements.
     * This means that each element can occur only once in the set.
     * The Set interface is part of the java.util package and provides several methods for adding,
     * removing, and querying elements in the set.
     *
     * Some commonly used methods of the Set interface include:
     *
     * add(element) : Adds the specified element to the set if it is not already present.
     * remove(element) : Removes the specified element from the set if it is present.
     * contains(element) : Returns true if the set contains the specified element, otherwise returns false.
     * size() : Returns the number of elements in the set.
     * isEmpty() : Returns true if the set is empty, otherwise returns false.
     * clear() : Removes all elements from the set.
     * There are several implementations of the Set interface in Java, including:
     *
     * HashSet: This implementation uses a hash table to store elements and provides
     * constant-time performance for basic operations like add,
     * remove, and contains, assuming a good hash function is used.
     *
     * TreeSet: This implementation uses a red-black tree to store elements in sorted order,
     * according to their natural ordering or a custom Comparator.
     * The basic operations (add, remove, contains, etc.) have time complexity of O(log n).
     * LinkedHashSet:
     * This implementation is similar to HashSet, but it maintains a doubly-linked list of elements in
     * the order they were inserted, allowing for iteration in insertion order.
     *
     *
     * It's worth noting that Set does not allow duplicate elements,
     * but it doesn't guarantee the order of elements. If you need to maintain the order of elements,
     * you might consider using a List or a LinkedHashSet.*/
